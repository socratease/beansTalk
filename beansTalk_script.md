# Beanstalk / Magic BeansTalk — Scroll-Driven Script (Markdown)

> **Format note:** Each section below corresponds to a **screen** or **scroll beat** in the experience. I’ve preserved your wording, tightened only the formatting, and kept all cues (scene, script, scroll events, cards, tables, animations).

## 0) Starting Screen — Pastoral Prologue

**Visual (Background):** Idyllic watercolor pastoral scene — rolling hills, blue sky, small cottage/farmhouse.

**Voiceover / Script:**

> Once upon a time, there lived a poor woman, her poor cow, and her poor son Jack. Jack was out in town, and met a man who claimed he had magic beans. Jack, a naïve boy, traded the poor cow for the magic beans.

## 1) The Magic Bean Pitch (Frontier AI Labs)

**Voiceover / Script:**

> The goal of every frontier AI lab (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc) is to create automated researchers. As it stands today, scientific progress, across technology, biology, chemistry, medicine, materials, aerospace, computing, robotics -- it's all limited by the small amount of people that can do cutting edge research. There is optimism that AI can remove this bottleneck -- that we can create a "country full of geniuses" in a datacenter and can blow the top off of research in all of these areas.
>
> There is a concept from science fiction called the "singularity" that represents this concept: self-improving artificial intelligence, innovating at computer speed, improving the world faster than we can keep up. Diseases are cured, poverty is eliminated, supply chains are automated, humans live happily for hundreds of years. This is cry of the magic bean salesman.

**Scroll Events (Animated Layering):**

- As the script is voiced, a series of scroll triggers causes **Lottie animations** to drop from the sky into the scene, representing a journey from pastoral simplicity to a homey technology utopia.
  - A tractor
  - A modern windmill
  - A robot farmer
  - Small spaceship launch in the background
  - More whimsical futuristic things

---

## 23) Definition Card — Beanstalk

**Scroll Event:** A card with a more technical aesthetic appears with the definition:

> **Beanstalk:** *a novel, enormous infrastructure project in service of a beautiful dream.*

---

## 24) Definition Card — Scaling Hypothesis

**Scroll Event:** Scaling Hypothesis definition card, similar to the previous card.

**Voiceover / Script:**

> AI progress hinges on a pretty simple theory, which is called the Scaling Hypothesis. It observes that bigger models perform better. The human brain has billions of neurons, and trillions of synapses, or connections between those neurons.

---

## 25) Scaling Table (Compute / Cost / Growth)

## 26) Orders of Magnitude Demo (Cookies)

**Scroll Event (Illustration):**

- Start with a tiny single cookie/circle.
- Drop a pile of 10 more, then 100, then 1000.
- Then shower cookies until they take up the screen.
- Cookies eventually scroll away after the illustration.

**Voiceover / Script (Lead-in):**

> Bigger means adding more neurons and synapses to this artificial brain. It also requires more computers to do this.

**Voiceover / Script (Full Illustration):**

> When we say bigger, we're talking orders of magnitude. I want to fully illustrate this to help drive it home. Imagine you have 1 cookie. This is like GPT-0.5. You think this cookie is good, so you want to have 2 orders of magnitude more cookies. That's 1 + 2 zeros -- 100 cookies. You can get there in a day. Say you want another order of magnitude increase, so 1000 cookies. Now you're going to be baking for a week. GPT-2.
>
> Someone else tries the cookies and says they want 3 MORE order of magnitude increase in cookies. That's 1,000,000 cookies. That's one thousand people baking cookies for a week. This is getting big fast. This is GPT-3.
>
> A cookie company calls and they want to mass produce your cookies. They want 3 order-of-magnitude more cookies. That's 1 billion cookies. Now you have to get the entire population of Chattanooga metro area to bake for 2 weeks. This is GPT-4. We're not done. What will you do when you need 1 trillion cookies? That's 1 billion people making cookies for a week. An eighth of the world's population is making cookies -- the beanstalk that dominates the horizon. As the world talks about the consequences of your cookie empire, the beanstalk rises.

**Voiceover / Script (Bridge):**

> Both of these periods saw disproportionately massive investment in new research towards uncertain goals. The journey from magic beans to waltzing through a city in the sky was controversial and frenzied.

---

## 30) Roadmap Table — OOMs / Compute / Cost / Power

**Scroll Event:** The following table scrolls into view:

| Year | OOMs | Compute | Cost | Power | Power Illustration |

## 31) Table Highlighting — Confirmed / Reported Investments

**Scroll Events (Sequential Highlights):**

- 2024 compute cell
- 2026 power cell
- 2028 cost cell
- 2030 cost cell

**On-screen Script (Displayed with the Table):**

**Example 2024 investments:**

- Meta buys 350k H100s *(highlight 2024 compute cell)*
- Amazon bought 1 GW datacenter next to nuclear powerplant in PA *(highlight 2026 power cell)*

## 33) Historical Capex Table — % of GDP

**Scroll Event:** The following table scrolls into view:

| Capex Event | % of GDP |
|---|---:|
| Railways (UK) (1840s) | 7% |
| Electrification (US) (1930) | 0.5% |
| Manhattan Project (1944) | 1% |
| Interstate System (1958) | 1.5% |
| Apollo Project (1966) | 0.6% |
| Telecom Buildout (2000) | 1.2% |
| AI Capex (2025) | 1% |

**Voiceover / Script:**

> A beanstalk is not a bubble. Like a bubble, a beanstalk grows suddenly, but the similarities end there. A beanstalk is permanent connective tissue to a world we don't inhabit, but want to. The sense of wonder that entails is also sure to evoke fantastical ideas that never come to fruition. We don't know exactly what the world in the clouds holds in store for us. But unlike Jack's story, real beanstalks aren't a product of pure whimsy -- it only gets built when we're reasonably sure what's up there is worth it.
>
> AI is not a bubble -- it is a world historical event. It is a rare but precedented mobilization of capital towards a hypothesis that cannot be ignored. We are well beyond the "magic beans" stage. The beans are planted, the beanstalk is built, and we're onto exploring the Giant's castle, with all the risk and reward that poses.

## 36) Core Disciplines (Bullets Enter One-by-One)

**Scroll Event:** Title migrates to the top of the screen; bullets enter one at a time.

**Subtitle:** Core Disciplines on the Beanstalk

- Situational Awareness
- Energy
- Aspiration

**Voiceover / Script:**

> What are core disciplines, on the beanstalk and beyond?

---

## 37) Core Discipline #1 — Situational Awareness

**Voiceover / Script:**

> Situational Awareness - you must know what is happening around you. New paths are being forged, new tools invented, and many of them affect your journey. You can't climb the beanstalk effectively with your eyes closed. You can't tiptoe through the castle with Airpods in. There's a lot going on, which brings me to item 2:

---

## 38) Core Discipline #2 — Energy

**Voiceover / Script:**

> Energy -- There is no replacement for excitement and effort. Trepidation is also understandable -- and valuable -- but I recommend figuring out what specific part of the city in the sky you find most appealing and working towards that end. Which leads me to #3:

---

## 39) Core Discipline #3 — Aspiration

**Voiceover / Script:**

> Aspiration -- The city in the clouds that AI represents is a big unknown, with a lot of glamor, but also a lot to worry about. But there's something for everyone there. If you have trouble looking past some of the things that worry you -- and believe me, I'm right there with you -- I encourage you to look for the future that you are excited about.
>
> Ai can help cure rare diseases that currently don't get funding. AI can help people who feel overlooked by the healthcare system navigate their illnesses. There's a ton of good that is possible - so find what that world looks like, and work towards it.

**Core disciplines, shortened:**

- Read things
- Believe in something
